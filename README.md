# Linestead-Store-Customer-Purchase-Behaviour-Loyalty-Analysis
This project analyzes customer purchase behavior and loyalty at Linestead Store, focusing on top-performing categories, purchasing trends by region, customer demographics, loyalty status, and satisfaction. The insights help understand patterns and optimize promotions for better engagement.

The key insights uncovered from this analysis include:

**KEY INSIGHTS**

Electronics is the top-performing category with $289.7 million, followed by Clothing with $192.6 million in purchases. Additionally, Electronics has the highest promotion usage at 9,025, followed by Clothing at 5,971.

60.17% of total purchases come from Regular customers, while only 9.88% are Gold customers. This shows that regular customers represent a large portion of the sales, but thereâ€™s potential to convert them into more loyal segments like Silver and Gold.

The 22-31 age group makes the highest number of purchases, with 60,176 customers, far surpassing other age groups like 32-41 (36,449) and 42-51 (2,888).

Purchase by Region shows that the Northern region has the lowest purchase value, significantly trailing behind other regions (East leads, followed by West and South).

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

Focus on electronics and clothing promotions, as these categories drive the highest purchases. Expand or create targeted promotions specifically for these segments.

Engage regular customers by creating loyalty programs or incentives to increase retention and upgrade them to Silver or Gold status.

Develop personalized offers or promotions aimed at the 22-31 age group, as they are the most active in purchases. This could help in maximizing engagement and conversions from this demographic.

Implement marketing strategies specifically targeted at the Northern region to boost purchases, which are currently lower than in other regions.
